# Open access git repository for Xie, Jaeger, &amp; Kurumada 2021

This git repository contains large files and thus requires LFS. 
If you're using Github Desktop to clone this git, it should automatically ask you whether you want to initialize LFS for this repository. 
If you're cloning the repository throught git or RStudio or some other software, you will have to install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) 
yourself *prior* to cloning this repository. This installation process is very fast and easy (1-2 clicks). 

All other requirements pertain to R libraries and software that can be downloaded after cloning this repository, and are described in the 
first section of the supplementary information of the manuscript.
