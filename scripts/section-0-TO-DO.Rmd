# THINGS TO DO
Let's delete to-dos after they have been addressed, and post in Slack what we've done. Thanks.

  * Everyone: 
    * Think about where comment about parameter space partitioning could go.
    * Should we either use 1\$\beta$ of 1\$\kappa$ etc. to conceptually make all parameters either 'confidence' / weight of prior knowledge OR learning rates? 
    * What's going on with "talker-related" vs. "talker-specific". I guess the former was introduced by someone to NOT assume talker-specific. That's the type of terminological change that one should make others aware of to make sure we are consistent throughout the paper. 
    * In 6.1, make sure that we're clear whether e.g., norris et al (and other findings) that can't be accounted for by normalization can be accounted for by decision-making? 
    * Also in 6.1, about the sine tone experiment, how is that ever going to allow us to investigate whether adaptation to natural variability is due to just normalization? These paradigms cannot be scaled to study how multiple mechanisms come together.
    * Be sure to integrate "parameter space partioning" comment by reviewer.

  * **Xin:**
    * Missing Figure in discussion
    * Are you ok with removing footnote 2? It seems not that important? Will anyone miss it? error correction seems sufficiently different from what we're doing?
    
  * **Chigusa:**
    * There are a handful of new references. Could you add them?

  * Florian: 
    * CHECK OUT WHETHER CHANGES IN NORMALIZATION CAN LEAD TO NON-LINEAR CHANGES *DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING SIMPLE LINEAR INTERPOLATION*

## Things to perhaps do later:

  * Florian
    * make a wrapper for categorization function (through optional argument) that makes the functions monotonic. do the math.



## Somewhere list all the factors that can determine power during test:

1. the expected change in the categorization function during exposure (describe elsewhere what this is a fucntion of)

2. the location of the test tokens

3. the task used during test
3a. the lapse rate, which is a function of how boring and/or streneous the task is
3b. response biases
3c. response decision criterion relaxation

4. the dependent variable
4a. the measurement noise
4b. the inherent variability

5. anything that undoes the exposure effect, limited the effective sample size.

6. the choice of analysis
6a. validity of assumptions
