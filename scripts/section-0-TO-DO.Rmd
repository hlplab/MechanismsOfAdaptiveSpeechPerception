# THINGS TO DO LATER:
  * Xin:
    * We probably need to spell out in the SI how you generated the data for the AA section. Have a look what I did for the PR section (in the SI)?

  * Chigusa:
   * GO THROUGH ALL THE COMMENTS THAT START WITH "TO DO" OR "TO-DO". THIS INCLUDES CHECKING SOME CLAIMS WE MAKE CAREFULLY AND LEAVING COMMENTS THAT CONFIRM THEM (OR CHANGE THE CONTENT).

  * Florian: 
    * CHECK OUT WHETHER CHANGES IN NORMALIZATION CAN LEAD TO NON-LINEAR CHANGES *DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING SIMPLE LINEAR INTERPOLATION*
    * CHANGE TEST RESPONSES TO OVERALL CATEGORIZATION FUNCTIONS AND THEN POINT OUT THAT THIS *UNDER*ESTIMATES THE AMBIGUITY OF EXISTING RESULTS. LINK TO DISCUSSION ABOUT MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF THE PARAMETER

 * Things to add later:
  * changed beliefs for case studies? 
  * make a wrapper for categorization function (through optional argument) that makes the functions monotonic. do the math.
  

Somewhere list all the factors that can determine power during test:

1. the expected change in the categorization function during exposure (describe elsewhere what this is a fucntion of)

2. the location of the test tokens

3. the task used during test
3a. the lapse rate, which is a function of how boring and/or streneous the task is
3b. response biases
3c. response decision criterion relaxation

4. the dependent variable
4a. the measurement noise
4b. the inherent variability

5. anything that undoes the exposure effect, limited the effective sample size.

6. the choice of analysis
6a. validity of assumptions
