# THINGS TO DO
Let's delete to-dos after they have been addressed, and post in Slack what we've done. Thanks.

  * Everyone: 
    * Think about where comment about parameter space partitioning could go.
    * Should we either use 1\$\beta$ of 1\$\kappa$ etc. to conceptually make all parameters either 'confidence' / weight of prior knowledge OR learning rates? 
    * What's going on with "talker-related" vs. "talker-specific". I guess the former was introduced by someone to NOT assume talker-specific. That's the type of terminological change that one should make others aware of to make sure we are consistent throughout the paper. 

  * **Xin:**
    * Missing Figure in final section of SI
    * Are you ok with removing footnote 2? It seems not that important? Will anyone miss it? error correction seems sufficiently different from what we're doing?
    
  * **Chigusa:**
    * There are a handful of new references. Could you add them?

  * Florian: 
    * for the decision-making model, run multiple instances of each version and take the average. unlike the other models it is not order invariant, and especially for large beta_pi it can depend a lot on the last exposure token.
    * CHECK OUT WHETHER CHANGES IN NORMALIZATION CAN LEAD TO NON-LINEAR CHANGES *DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING SIMPLE LINEAR INTERPOLATION*

## Things to perhaps do later:

  * Florian
    * make a wrapper for categorization function (through optional argument) that makes the functions monotonic. do the math.
