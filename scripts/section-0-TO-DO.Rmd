# THINGS TO DO
Let's delete to-dos after they have been addressed, and post in Slack what we've done. Thanks.

  * Xin:
    * fig 29:
      * make sure that best-fitting decision-making model in Fig 29 is correct (using same max sims as in the previous figures)
    * SI and Discussion, improve 3d figures by removing white space around them. Might be achieved by zoom, or by handing orca the right parameters.
    
  * Everyone:
    * FILL in URL-PLACEHOLDER in 4 figure captions in Section 2. 

## Things to perhaps do later:

  * Florian
    * make a wrapper for categorization function (through optional argument) that makes the functions monotonic. do the math.
    * CHECK OUT WHETHER CHANGES IN NORMALIZATION CAN LEAD TO NON-LINEAR CHANGES *DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING SIMPLE LINEAR INTERPOLATION*
  *　Consider adding a footnote in PR section that nothing would change if ambiguous tokens were taken to be identical. note also that there is no ‘true’ identity since the context changes.
